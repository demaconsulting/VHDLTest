# Introduction

This document provides justifications and rationale for the requirements specified in the VHDLTest Requirements
document.

## Purpose

Understanding the rationale behind requirements is essential for:

* Making informed design decisions during implementation
* Evaluating proposed changes and their impact on system objectives
* Communicating requirement intent to stakeholders
* Ensuring requirements remain relevant throughout the product lifecycle
* Supporting regulatory compliance and audit activities

## Contents

For each requirement in the VHDLTest requirements specification, this document provides:

* Requirement identifier and title
* Detailed justification explaining why the requirement exists
* Context about the requirement's importance and value
* Rationale for design decisions reflected in the requirement

## Justification Categories

The justifications address several key areas:

### User Experience

Requirements that improve usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction. These ensure VHDLTest is intuitive and
efficient for both novice and experienced users.

### Integration and Compatibility

Requirements ensuring VHDLTest integrates properly with CI/CD systems, build tools, and various VHDL simulators.
These enable the tool to fit seamlessly into existing workflows.

### Platform Support

Requirements ensuring VHDLTest operates reliably across different operating systems and .NET runtime versions. These
enable broad adoption and deployment flexibility.

### Quality Assurance

Requirements supporting testing, validation, and verification of VHDLTest itself. These ensure the tool meets quality
standards and provides confidence in its operation.

### Standards Compliance

Requirements that align with industry standards, best practices, and regulatory expectations. These ensure VHDLTest
can be used in regulated environments requiring formal documentation.

## Document Usage

This document should be consulted when:

* Evaluating the priority or necessity of a requirement
* Assessing the impact of requirement changes
* Understanding design trade-offs
* Preparing for audits or compliance reviews
* Onboarding new team members to the project

Each justification provides context to support informed decision-making throughout the product lifecycle.
