# Introduction

This document contains the code quality analysis report for the VHDLTest project.

## Purpose

This report serves as evidence that the VHDLTest codebase maintains good quality
standards. It provides a comprehensive analysis of code quality metrics, including
quality gate status, code issues, security hot spots, technical debt, and code coverage.

## Scope

This code quality report covers:

- Quality gate status and conditions
- Code issues categorized by type and severity
- Security hot spots requiring review
- Technical debt assessment
- Code coverage and duplication metrics

## Analysis Source

This report contains quality analysis results captured at the time this version of VHDLTest
was built. It serves as evidence that the code maintains good quality standards and provides
transparency about the project's code health. The analysis includes results from various
quality tools run during the build process.

## Audience

This document is intended for:

- Software developers working on VHDLTest
- Quality assurance teams reviewing code quality
- Project stakeholders evaluating project health
- Contributors understanding quality standards
